          Welcome to my digital space! I'm <strong>Jose Chemmanoor</strong>, a passionate BTech student specializing in 
          Computer Science and Engineering at Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology (RSET) in Kakkanad, Kochi. 
          <br /><br />
          While I currently call Kochi home, my journey began in the bustling city of Thrissur, Kerala. I pursued my early 
          education at Don Bosco ICSE School, Mannuthy, and later completed my higher secondary studies at St. Joseph’s 
          School, Kuriachira.
          <br /><br />
          Fueled by curiosity and a love for technology, I’m on a mission to explore the ever-evolving world of computer science. 
          Join me as we dive into this exciting field, sharing knowledge and experiences along the way!
